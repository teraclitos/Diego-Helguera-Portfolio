# Architect portfolio

Architect portfolio developed with pure javascript and css. It was a great challenge for me, since it was the first one I did. It was a sort of a craft project; for example, on the desktop version, the spatial arrangement of the houses on the main page does not follow a rigid and predetermined structure, instead, each house was individually positioned . It is not very scalable but it showcases a unique style. On the desktop version, you can dynamically zoom in on each picture for a detailed view of the houses.
